# EXERCISE-911-Calls-Montgomery-PA
Data from this kaggle page - https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert - was used to extract information.  
The objective was to learn and exercise some of capabilities of the following Python libraries:
* Pandas
* Numpy 
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly  
  
This exercise is based on the "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" from John Portilla, at Udemy.  
The GitHub page directs to a map generated with the code, which shows the total number of 911 calls per township in Montgomery.  
Please note that this is just an exercise, it's not meant to be used to take conclusions of any sort.
