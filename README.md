# EXERCISE-911-Calls-Montgomery-PA
Data from this [kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert) was used to extract information.  
The objective was to learn and exercise some capabilities of the following Python libraries:
* Pandas
* Numpy 
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly  
  
This exercise is based on the "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" from John Portilla, at Udemy.  
The [GitHub page directs to a map](https://key0412.github.io/EXERCISE-911-Calls-Montgomery-PA/) generated with the code, which shows the total number of 911 calls per township in Montgomery.  
**Please note that this is just an exercise, it's not meant to be used to take conclusions of any sort.**
